## Screens and Components

- Load more nearby categories

### 3. `ContentView`

Main view of the app that integrates the map and allows users to:

The app uses a `ZStack` to combine map display, modals, and additional features.

### 6. `SwiftDataViewModel`

This view model handles the persistence of favorite and recent locations using **SwiftData**.

- **Favorites**: Users can add and remove locations from their favorites list.
- **Recents**: The app automatically saves recently viewed locations.
- Data is fetched and stored using `ModelContainer` and `FetchDescriptor` from SwiftData.
